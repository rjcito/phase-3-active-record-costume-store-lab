## Learning Goals

- Create migrations using Active Record
- Interact with a SQL database table from a Ruby class using Active Record

## Active Record Review

Active Record is magic. Well, not really. But it does build out a bunch of
methods for you. For instance, when it's used properly it will give you access
to methods such as `create`, `save`, and `find_by`. Rejoice! Never again will
you have to manually build out these methods!

Active Record allows you to create a database that interacts with your class
with only a few lines of code. These lines of code go to creating a model, which
resides in the `app/models` folder, and a migration, which resides in the
`db/migrate` folder.

The model inherits from `ActiveRecord::Base` while the migration inherits from
`ActiveRecord::Migration`. Many migrations these days have a `change` method,
but you might also see migrations with an `up` and a `down` method instead. To
use Active Record, you have to stick to some specific naming conventions: while
the migrations are plural, the models are singular.

### Migrations

When creating migrations, the class names in the migration files must match
their file names. For instance, a class in the migration file called
`20141013204115_create_candies.rb` must be named `CreateCandies` while a class
in a migration file called `20130915204319_add_addresses_to_houses.rb` must be
called AddAddressesToHouses.

You might notice that in both the examples above, the numbers at the front of
the file name were ignored. These numbers are in the form `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS`.
These timestamps are used to determine which migration should be run and in what
order. For instance, if you made a table called `dog_walkers` and then added a
column to it called `rating`, that would be fine as the timestamp on the
`dog_walkers` table creation would indicate it needs to be migrated before
adding the `rating` column to it. However, if you did this in reverse order,
that is adding a column to a table that doesn't exist, then creating the table,
you would get an error.

Migrations, as it was mentioned before, inherit from `ActiveRecord::Migration`
and usually have a method called `change`. In change, you can create a table
with the [create_table][] method. This method automatically will create a
primary key column called `id`, but this default can be overridden if you'd like
to customize it.

[create_table]: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html#creating-a-table

Here's a simple example of the `create_table` method in action:

```ruby
class CreateDogs < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
  def change
    create_table :dogs do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.string :breed
    end
  end
end
```

The above code would create a table called `dogs` with three columns: `name`,
`breed` (both explicitly created), and an implicitly created `id` column.

Take a look at a few data types that Active Record supports below:

| Data Type | Examples                                              |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| boolean   | true, false                                           |
| integer   | 2, -13, 485                                           |
| string    | "Halloween", "Boo!", strings between 1-255 characters |
| datetime  | DateTime.now, DateTime.new(2014,10,31)                |
| float     | 2.234, 32.2124, -6.342                                |
| text      | strings between 1 and 2 ^ 32 - 1 characters           |

### Models

Like migrations, models also inherit some code from Active Record, but they
inherit from `ActiveRecord::Base`. A simple model would look like this:

```ruby
class Dog < ActiveRecord::Base
end
```

Even though there are no explicit methods for retrieving `name` and `breed`,
this `Dog` model is associated with the created `dogs` table above. Because of
this integration, we can call `name`, `breed`, and `id` on any new instance of
the Dog class. For example:

```ruby
shiloh = Dog.new
# => #<Dog id: 1, name: nil, breed: nil>
shiloh.name = "Shiloh"
# => "Shiloh"
shiloh.breed = "Beagle"
# => "Beagle"
shiloh.save
# => true

Dog.find_by(:name => "Shiloh") == shiloh
# => true
```

Notice that you had access to reader and writer methods that work with the
database that you never had to actually code in the model itself. You could set
the name without ever writing `def name=()` and call the
`self.find_by(attribute)` method without ever teaching your `Dog` class how to
look up data in the database. It's pretty awesome. Take a look at an example
below.

#### Example

Let's say you wanted to make a class called `Candy`. Candies should have two
attributes, a name (string) and the number of calories (integer). You would
write the migration as seen below:

```ruby
# db/migrate/20130915204319_create_candies.rb
class CreateCandies < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.1]
  def change
    create_table :candies do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.integer :calories
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

> **Note**: You might be wondering what `t.timestamps` is doing here. Well, it
> creates two new columns, `created_at` and `updated_at`. These are handy
> columns to have around, as sometimes you want to query based on the time a
> record was created or updated instead of querying using attributes or ids. To
> read more about timestamps, go to Active Record's [docs on them][timestamps].

While the table name was plural, the model would be singular:

```ruby
# app/models/candy.rb
class Candy < ActiveRecord::Base
end
```

After saving the code above, running `rake db:migrate` will apply the desired
changes to the database by running the change method. Then you can alter the
database with simple Ruby statements.

For instance, you could create three rows in the table easily:

```ruby
Candy.create(name: "Milky Way Midnight", calories: 220)
Candy.create(name: "Snickers", calories: 550)
Candy.create(name: "Reese's Peanut Butter Cups", calories: 210)
```

Retrieving information is just as painless:

```ruby
reeses = Candy.find_by(:name => "Reese's Peanut Butter Cups")
# => #<Candy id: 3, name: "Reese's Peanut Butter Cups", calories: 210>
Candy.first
# => #<Candy id: 1, name: "Milky Way Midnight", calories: 220>
snickers = Candy.find(2)
# => #<Candy id: 2, name: "Snickers", calories: 550>
```

As is viewing attributes:

```ruby
reeses = Candy.find(3)
# => #<Candy id: 3, name: "Reese's Peanut Batter Cups", calories: 210>
reeses.calories
# => 210
reeses.name
# => "Reese's Peanut Batter Cups"
```

Updating information and viewing table info is also quite simple:

```ruby
snickers = Candy.find(2)
# => #<Candy id: 2, name: "Snickers", calories: 550>
snickers.update(:calories => 250)
# => true

reeses = Candy.last
# => #<Candy id: 3, name: "Reese's Peanut Batter Cups", calories: 210>
reeses.update(:name => "Reeeese's Peanut Butter Cups")
# => true

Candy.find(2)
# => #<Candy id: 2, name: "Snickers", calories: 250>
Candy.last
# => #<Candy id: 3, name: "Reeeese's Peanut Butter Cups", calories: 210>
```

Isn't that amazing? Eleven lines of code allows you to create a table and a
class that interact with each other elegantly and efficiently. It builds out
methods like, `create`, `update`, `count`, `name`, `calories`, along with others
such as `build` and `save`.

## Instructions

In this lab, you'll be creating the following tables: `costumes`,
`costume_stores`, and `haunted_houses`. You'll be creating the following
classes: `Costume`, `CostumeStore`, and `HauntedHouse`.

The `costumes` table will have four columns:

1. name (string)
2. price (float)
3. size (string)
4. image_url (string)

_as well as_ the two [timestamp][timestamps] columns: `created_at` and
`updated_at`. This will provide a grand total of _six_ columns.

The `costume_stores` table will have seven columns:

1. name (string)
2. location (string)
3. costume_inventory (integer)
4. num_of_employees (integer)
5. is_in_business (boolean)
6. opening_time (datetime)
7. closing_time (datetime)

The `haunted_houses` table will have eight columns:

1. name (string)
2. location (string)
3. theme (string)
4. price (float)
5. family_friendly (boolean)
6. opening_date (datetime)
7. closing_date (datetime)
8. description (text)

Before coding out the creation of these tables, read about Active Record below.

### File Structure

You will be altering code in three files in the `models` folder and creating
three files in the `db/migrate` folder.

```text
├── app
│   └── models
│       ├── costume.rb
│       ├── costume_store.rb
│       └── haunted_house.rb
└──db
    └── migrate
        ├── 001_create_costumes.rb
        ├── 002_create_costume_stores.rb
        └── 003_create_haunted_houses.rb
```

### Getting Started

**This is a test-driven lab so start with the first test and work your way
down.** Your models should be no longer than two lines of code. Most of your
work will be done in the migrations.

You can use `rake db:create_migration` to create the files for the migrations.

- The first step is to run `bundle install`.
- Create the `Costume` class in `app/models/costume.rb`.
- Fill out the Active Record migration for the `costumes` table such that it
  passes the specs.
- Create the `CostumeStore` class in `app/models/costume_store.rb`.
- Fill out the Active Record migration for the `costume_stores` table such that
  it passes the specs.
- Create the `HauntedHouse` class in `app/models/haunted_house.rb`.
- Fill out the Active Record migration for the `haunted_houses` table such that
  it passes the specs.

When running your migrations and rollbacks, use `RACK_ENV=test` in order to run
the migrations for the test environment:

```console
$ bundle exec rake db:migrate RACK_ENV=test
$ bundle exec rake db:rollback RACK_ENV=test
```

You can also run the migrations without `RACK_ENV=test`, which will migrate the
development database. This is helpful if you want to explore the code from the
console:

```console
$ bundle exec rake db:migrate
$ bundle exec rake console
```

Just like for any other lab, run `learn test` to view your test progress.
However, unlike some of the other labs in this section, for this lab, when
updating an existing migration, **you will need to rollback your previous
migrations for that table using the Rake command
`rake db:rollback RACK_ENV=test`**. Otherwise, the schema will remain unchanged
and the changes you make to your migrations will not be seen.

For example, say you've run `rake db:migrate RACK_ENV=test` and `learn test`
once to start, and see that you need to add an attribute to the `costume_stores`
table. Since this table is the second migration of three, you will need to run
`rake db:rollback RACK_ENV=test` twice to remove the previous migration for this
table, then run `rake db:migrate RACK_ENV=test` again to update the schema. Your
code, however, may break if the other migration files are empty.
